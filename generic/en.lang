MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_ExpressTrain=Today you will drive an express train.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_FastTrain=Today you will drive an express train.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_WelcomeDriver=Welcome to SimRail multiplayer. Today you will play the role of a train Driver for the first time.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_AI=Currently the train is under AI control. When you're ready, you can take control by pressing the button at the top of the screen at any time.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_AFK=If you will be inactive for a long time, the AI will take over the train for you automatically.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_Remember=Remember that you are cooperating with other players. Please pay attention to traffic lights and speed limits.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_Comm=To communicate with other players, you can use a radiotelephone as a voice chat (by default, a tilde on the keyboard) and text chat on the left side of the screen.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_RadioChannel1=In order for other players in the area to receive your message, you must be on the same radio channel. After taking over from AI, the radio channel will automatically be set to the correct one on the given line.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_RadioChannel2=When passing the indicator with the letter R and a number, change the radio channel accordingly - the number indicates the valid channel. You can also activate the automatic change of radio channels in the settings.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Driver_PlayersList=To check if the station you are approaching is operated by a human or AI, open the player list (tab key by default). You can also use it to report players who deliberately spoil the game for others, as well as those who are inactive.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Welcome=Welcome to SimRail multiplayer. Today you will play as a Dispatcher for the first time.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Systems=There are 3 basic systems at your disposal - control panel, timetable and communication.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Comm=You can communicate with neighboring Dispatcher by phone. If that signal box is operated by AI, you will see the relevant information on your phone.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_AI=In this situation, communication will take place using ready text messages selected from the list. It is different when that station is operated by another player.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Human=In this situation, you have a choice, you can use ready messages, write freely in the chat window with a specific post, or choose a voice call.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Voice=If you want to use the voice call, pick up the telephone handset and press the button to select the station you want to call.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_IncommingCall=If someone calls you, all you have to do is pick up the phone.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Radio=The second type of communication is by use of radio. To contact train Drivers near you, use the chat on the left or voice communication (tilde on the keyboard by default).
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_RadioChannel=Remember that only players in the area who have their radio set to the same channel as your signal box will hear you.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Playerslist=To see players in your area, open the list (tab key by default). You can also use it to report players who deliberately ruin the game for others, as well as those who are inactive.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Timetable1=To check which trains are approaching your station, you have a timetable monitor at your disposal.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Timetable2=You will find out from it, whether the train has a stop at your station, how long it have been delayed, from which side it will arrive and where it should be sent.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_MultipleStations=Remember that some stations, such as Sosnowiec Główny, have remote signal box controlled by us - in this case Sosnowiec R52. To check their schedule, switch the tab on the monitor.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_NearbyTrains=Nearby trains can be observed in the field on the left along with the distance and name of the nearest semaphore. The beginning of the name means the abbreviation of the station, and then the unique symbol of a given semaphore.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_Computer=You can use a computer or cube desktop to control the signalbox. Detailed instructions for using the desktops can be found under the "i" icon. Please familiarize yourself with it.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_LineBlocks=Remember that you can encounter automatic and semi-automatic blockades connecting two stations.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_AutomaticLB=In the automatic blockade, you do not have to ask for the consent of the neighboring station for the departure of the train, but only inform the neighboring Dispatcher about the departure of the train.
MultiplayerIntroduction_Dispatcher_OthersLB=Otherwise, before the departure of the train, it is necessary to ask the neighboring station for permission to dispatch the train by using  telephone communication, and then using the desktop.
