Random_Rim=Most rail vehicles use wheels consisting of two parts. The proper wheel (which is located in the middle) and the replaceable rim. This is to reduce operating costs - when worn, only the rim is replaced, not the entire wheel. The white stripes make it possible to detect rim misalignment, which is very dangerous and requires the vehicle to be immobilized immediately.
Random_LineNumber1_1=The railway line No. 1 available in SimRail is part of the historic Warsaw-Vienna Railway, which was one of the first railroads in what is now Poland. It was established in 1845 and connected Warsaw with the border of the Austrian partition (Galicia).
Special_DrivenTheDistance=You have already driven for at least {0}.

Random_4=The longest railroad tunnels in Poland are located on the route from Klodzko to Walbrzych. They run under the Mały Wołowiec mountain, have an elliptical shape and are 1601 and 1560 meters long. Although the two tunnels run parallel, only one of them is currently in use.
Random_5=\nThe Szklarska Poreba Jakuszyce station, located at 886 meters above sea level, is the highest railroad station in Poland. It is located in Jakuszyce, a district of Szklarska Poreba.
Random_6=The fastest passenger trains in Poland are the Pendolino ED250, which can reach speeds of 200 km/h on selected sections. During tests on the Central Magisterial Railway in 2013, the vehicle reached a record speed of 293 km/h, which is still the speed record on the Polish railroad.
